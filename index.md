    Everley Tseng is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, advised by Professor Danna Gurari in the [Image and Video Computing (IVC) Group](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~DrG/IVC_Group.html). Her research advances computer vision through dataset-driven discovery of new problem spaces. She develops benchmarks and evaluation frameworks that expose the limitations of current vision-language models in real-world applications, especially for people who are blind or have low vision. Her work spans vision-language modeling, dataset curation, visual privacy, image segmentation, and few-shot learning, resulting in publicly released datasets such as VizWiz-FewShot and BIV-Priv-Seg. Everley is passionate about bridging academic innovation and industry-scale deployment, focusing on creating trustworthy and efficient visual AI systems that address real accessibility and privacy challenges.
