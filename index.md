> I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, advised by Professor Danna Gurari in the [Image and Video Computing (IVC) Group](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~DrG/IVC_Group.html). My research centers on developing vision systems that can accurately segment and track objects and their constituent parts across images and videos. I focus on image and video instance segmentation, multi-object tracking, and dataset creation.
>  
> Before beginning my Ph.D., I worked as a Computer Scientist at the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), where I developed reinforcement learning systems for various defense simulations. Earlier, I spent several years as a research intern at Los Alamos National Laboratory, contributing to projects in cryptography, network analysis, and astrophysics. I earned my B.S. in Mathematics & Computer Science from UC San Diego and have since gained experience across industry and research labs. I am currently an AI engineering intern at LightTable, where I hope to continue bridging academic innovation and industry-scale deployment in computer vision.
